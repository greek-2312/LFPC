# Laboratory Work Task No. 1 Regular Grammar to Finite Automato

Using Finite Automaton (FA) check if some input string is accepted by FA (meaning you could generate that string by traversing FA).

Accepted string:

String was not accepted:

The task is implemented in 'DFA.py' file.

# Laboratory Work Task No. 2 NFA to DFA conversion

Write program which converts nondeterministic finite automato (NFA) to deterministic finite automato (DFA).

### Visualisation of the DFA:

Where 1, 2 and 3 are terminal symbols. I wasn't able to implement the self-loops, because it was impossible for me to install pygraphviz package. But this visualisation
is possible for every grammar included in the text file.

### New transitions and all the rules obtained from transforming an NFA to DFA are stored in a dictionary.

The task is implemented in 'NFAtoDFA.py' file.
